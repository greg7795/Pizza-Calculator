Calculate the amount of flour, water, yeast, and salt needed for your pizza dough based on specific factors. 

Some of the the formulas and data used are based on information found in this repo:
https://github.com/hendricius/pizza-dough

and the yeast model found at:
https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,26831.msg349349.html#msg349349

Working example of the code is here:

The data options for fermentation temp and fermentation hours on the calculator are still incomplete. My goal was to get a working app and then fill in the rest of the data. The data can be found/modified in the /public/temps.json file.
